thank you good afternoon and Jim what was the thought process behind not giving strategic imperatives segment anymore and then how are you thinking about clouding cognitive software growth going forward relative to the two percent growth over the last couple of quarters and especially in the context of the delay deals that you're referencing %HESITATION income these question okay thanks Katie and %HESITATION appreciate the question %HESITATION around strategic imperatives again let me put this in perspective we put this sign posts out back in the beginning of two thousand and fifteen if you all remember at our investor day why because we had to lay the groundwork and how as a company we needed to fundamentally shift our capital investment allocation and transform our portfolio into capturing this shift in growth in cloud and data and analytics and security and mobility now you fast forward to the end of twenty eighteen and at the time we made this announcement with that sign post we were about less than a quarter is worth of our business I think Patricia we exited eighteen we're we were consistently above fifty percent 
and would you take a look at that that is become more more or I should say less and less of a relevant metric as we move forward and more importantly as I've spent quite a bit of time over the last quarter both at thank with many of our viewers analyst and also with our investors to talk about as we change our external segmentation to re position and get this company focused on chapter two and the journey to cloud and hybrid cloud the same feedback we got from many of you and many of our investors is the strategic imperative metrics is did is pass this course and they are looking for now what are the relevant metrics on on managing %HESITATION the company moving forward and that is we put out in our new segmentation is going to be around cloud in particular accelerating our leadership position in a one trillion dollar market opportunity around hybrid that is going to be around as a service and our scale efficiencies and margin and finally it's going to be around operating leverage and value and that is going to be instantiated in gross margin and operating pre tax margin
